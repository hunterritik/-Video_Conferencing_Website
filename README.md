# Note
You can create a free xirsys account and use their free ice server. You can replace the one used with your own at `src/assets/js/helpers.js`, function `getIceServer()`. The demo may not work as my xirsys account has been deactivated for reasons best known to them (perhaps the hits were too much) and I am not ready to create a new one. Create yours or look for an alternative.
